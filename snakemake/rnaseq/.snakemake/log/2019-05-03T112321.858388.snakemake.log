Relative file path './fastqc/' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

Provided cores: 1
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	fastqc
